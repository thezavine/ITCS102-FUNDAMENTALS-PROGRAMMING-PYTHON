Hi, I am Azeth Arvine L. Brandes, student from 
BSIT First Year
Section 1A

This is my first file in my REPO.

About Me:
From Barangay 8, Lagos street, Lucena City. I am 20 yrs old and I was
born on December 27, 2004. My hobbies are watching anime, reading 
online comics, and playing online games. My dream is to become a
professional programmer so, I want to be confident enough to be able
to catch up with my classmates in terms of knowledge in the field
Information Technology(I.T). I also have a part-time job to support
myself financially.
